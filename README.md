## FlowFI

FlowFI (Flow cytometry Feature Importance) is a python-based, graphically enabled interface to enable experimentalists to perform data driven feature importance analysis of flow cytometry spectral and possibly also imaging features for gating. The software is capable of analysing data from any generic .fcs file but was tested using data generated with the BD FACSDiscoverâ„¢ S8 Cell Sorter from BD Biosciences that allows for a range of spectral and imaging features.

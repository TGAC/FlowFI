## FlowFI

FlowFI is a python-based, graphical interface for performing feature importance analysis of flow cytometry features to guide the process of slecting spectral and possibly also imaging features for gating. The software is capable of analysing data from any generic .fcs file but was tested using data generated with the BD FACSDiscoverâ„¢ S8 Cell Sorter from BD Biosciences.
